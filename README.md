# competitive_programming_mylib
This repo contains implementation of some commonly used data structures and algorithm in competitive programming, for which there is no library available in c++ stl. The libaray is implemented on top of existing containers(vector, queue,..) available in c++ stl.

##### Disjoint Set Union (dsu.h):
We are given several elements, each of which is a separate set. A DSU will have an operation to combine any two sets, and it will be able to tell in which set a specific element is.
